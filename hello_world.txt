Hello from Windows!
What happens if I make changes while in the staging area?
Now I have this file both as staged and as modified. Interesting.
And VS Code can show me the changes between those two versions of the file.
VS Code is awesome!
Windows is stupid. I would like my lines to end with LF, thank you very much.

And now, hello from Linux!
This is much better. At least for this sort of things.
And VS Code is still awesome!
