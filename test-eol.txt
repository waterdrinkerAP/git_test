This is a simple text file.
Here I will test how git handles line endings with different settings.
When created this file has it's line endings set as LF.
When committing and pushing line endings are still LF.
When pulling from Linux line endings are still LF.
After pulling from Windows line endings change to CRLF.
Let's see what will happen if I push the file now.
