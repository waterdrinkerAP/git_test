This is a simple text file.
Here I will test how git handles line endings with different settings.
When created this file has it's line endings set as LF.
When committing and pushing line endings are still LF.
When pulling from Linux line endings are still LF.
After pulling from Windows line endings change to CRLF.
Let's see what will happen if I push the file now.
When pulling from Linux again line endings are LF.
So autocrlf=true converts line endings to CRLF when pulling in Windows
but then converts them back to LF when pushing.
Interesting!
What if I want Windows to also use LF?
When pulling on Windows with autocrlf=input this file's endings are LF
but a different unchanged file still has CRLF endings.
What will happen if I change it around a bit?
Okay, what if I set autocrlf=false and eol=crlf?
So far nothing has changed.
And after pulling on Windows nothing has changed.
Strange.
So I am guessing that unless you have autocrlf=true
you will never pull a file with CRLF line endings?
Yep that seems to be the case.
Let me try just one more thing.
Nope, I was wrong.
You can infact push a file with CRLF and then pull it with CRLF.
Damn it! I have to figure out how to fix that.
